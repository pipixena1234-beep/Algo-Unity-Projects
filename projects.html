        <h2>First Person Platformer [3D]</h2>
        <p>I created a project about Smiskis! They are tiny... creatures, hiding in your room! I learned a few things from making this website; adding pictures and links. </p>

        <h2>Third Person Platformer [3D]</h2>
        <p>I designed a website on my favourite movie. This project shows a variety of things, such as the text being a tone darker than the background, pictures and buttons.</p>

        <h2>Space Shooter [2D]</h2>
        <p>This project is a tutorial on how to prepare your cup of noodles. I discovered a new trick while making this website, that was making some texts bold. I also used a color wheel to use different, matching tones.</p>
